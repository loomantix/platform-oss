# Agent-loop instructions

You're working autonomously on a single GitHub issue in this repository. Read this file fully, then read `gh issue view <N>` for your assigned issue. Work the issue, open a PR, and exit.

> **Customize this file before running `/agent-loop`.** It was created from a starter template on first sync from upstream. Sections marked `TODO:` need values for your repo. The file lives at the repo root and is _not_ overwritten by subsequent syncs (its sync target uses `create_if_missing: true`).

## Repo overview

TODO: 2–3 sentences describing this repo. Tech stack, what it produces, who consumes it.

## Build / test

TODO: list the commands an agent should run to verify a change locally before pushing. Example shape:

```bash
# install deps
<install command>

# build
<build command>

# unit + integration tests
<test command>

# format / lint
<format check command>
```

## Commit + PR rules

TODO: customize for this repo's conventions. Common conventions to keep or remove:

- **Conventional commits** if used: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`. PR titles match.
- **DCO sign-off** if enforced: every commit needs `git commit -s`. CI rejects PRs without the trailer.
- **Signed commits** if required on the base branch — don't bypass with `--no-gpg-sign` or `-c commit.gpgsign=false`.
- **Annotated tags** if used: `git tag -a -m "..."`.
- **PR base branch**: TODO (often `main`; some repos use `staging` or another).
- **Heredocs in `gh` commands cause permission prompts** — write multiline bodies to a temp file first, then `gh pr create --body-file <path>`.

## What NOT to edit

If this repo consumes synced files from an upstream (check for `.github/workflows/sync-from-upstream.yml`), those files are overwritten on every sync — local edits are lost. The list below is a starting set; the canonical list lives in the upstream's sync manifest, not in your consumer repo. Adjust the entries below to match what your sync workflow actually pulls.

Common synced surfaces:

- `.claude/skills/**`
- `.claude/agents/**`
- `.claude/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md`
- `.claude/settings.json`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

If your issue requires changing any of these, **stop and post a comment on the issue** explaining the change belongs upstream. Don't edit the consumer copy — it'll be reverted on the next sync.

## Filesystem hygiene

- Use repo-scoped `/tmp` paths: `/tmp/<repo-name>/...` rather than bare `/tmp/foo` to avoid collisions across parallel sessions on the same machine.

## Out-of-scope guardrails

If you discover any of these mid-issue, **stop, comment on the issue with what you found, and exit without a PR**:

- The issue requires touching another repository (cross-repo coordination).
- The issue has open policy questions — re-read the body; if it asks "should we A or B?" or "decision needed," that's a human call.
- The issue requires deleting org-level secrets, modifying branch protection, or installing GitHub Apps — these have organization-wide blast radius and need human verification.
- Acceptance criteria can't be satisfied without changing the synced surfaces listed above.

## Pre-push review (if these skills are available)

Before pushing your PR, run the lean review chain (skip on docs/config-only changes):

1. `/refactorpass` — single `/simplify` pass.
2. `/grill` — runs `code-reviewer` and `silent-failure-hunter` agents on the diff.

## PR shape

```markdown
## Summary

<1–3 bullets, what changed and why>

## Test plan

- [ ] <build command>
- [ ] <test command>
- [ ] <issue-specific verification>

Closes #<N>
```

After opening the PR, run `/reviewit <pr-number>` to fire AI reviews and address findings. The lean default caps at 2 iterations.
