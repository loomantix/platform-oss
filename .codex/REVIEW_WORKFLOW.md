# Review Workflow

This file is synced from `loomantix/activeloom` into consumer repos. Consumer-specific
edits will be overwritten on the next sync.

## Automatic chain execution

For an explicitly requested automatic review chain, use the deterministic
`.codex/skills/critique/scripts/review-chain-runner.py` controller. Resolve the
tier and its triggers first, then supply either an exact `--chain` or a repeating
`--cycle --until-converged`. Do not implement the outer loop in conversation.
Read [runner usage](../.codex/references/review-chain-runner.md) before starting;
it defines required validation commands, durable checkpoints, and recovery.
The Codex control surface must be installed even when another engine starts
the command. If it is absent, report the missing installation; do not substitute
a raw reviewer CLI or silently fall back to a conversational auto loop.

Each worker owns one pass only. The runner owns launch order, result verification,
attestation, and bounded progression. Existing handoff sessions and the separate
issue-implementation `agent-loop` keep their own contracts. An active legacy run
is not silently converted to a new plan or granted a fresh budget.

## PR-First Rule

Open a draft pull request before any structured review cleanup such as
`refactorpass`, or adversarial review. Local author and reviewer passes use
GitHub review threads as durable shared context:
post each verified finding inline before editing, push the correction, reply
with the fix and validation, then resolve the thread. Every pass must read
resolved as well as unresolved threads before reviewing the current head.

Load [the local review ledger](references/local-review-ledger.md) before running
`refactorpass`, `critique`, `deepcritique`, `pr-critique`, or local review hooks.
That file is the engine-neutral protocol published by the
[`@loomantix/review-ledger`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@loomantix/review-ledger)
project and vendored verbatim into every engine repository, so all engines read
the same contract. The helper bundle beside it is vendored from that package's
published tarball and pinned by `review-ledger.version` and
`review-ledger.integrity`; CI byte-compares the bundle, not this document, so a
protocol edit must land upstream rather than here. Where the protocol writes
`<ledger-helper>`, this engine's path is:

```text
.codex/skills/critique/scripts/review-ledger.js
```

## Roles, Not Engine Names

The relay is defined over two roles:

- **author** — the engine that wrote the change. Exactly one.
- **reviewer** — an engine that reads the change cold. Zero, one, or more.

Codex is the author role when Codex wrote the change and a reviewer role
otherwise. No rule below names a specific engine, so adding a fourth changes
nothing here.

**One non-author reviewer is the recommended floor** and covers the great
majority of changes. A second earns its cost mainly where a defect is expensive
and hard to see: auth, crypto, secret handling, schema and data-shape work,
release and sync tooling, or a change whose blast radius crosses repositories.
Solo review is permitted but must be declared with a recorded reason.

The local relay and the hosted reviewers are **not competing paths** and no
longer need to be chosen between. See "Hosted Reviewers" below.

## Review Relay

Evaluate each returned pass against its engine's selected review scope and
reported execution. A direct pass is valid when that engine's policy permits it;
agent count is not a substitute for risk coverage. Preserve explicit user
requirements, the declared cross-engine roster, and the exact-head ledger.

### Claude invocation boundary

This boundary applies before selecting or entering a local session mode. Start
an independent Claude reviewer only through the synced, tested
`.codex/skills/critique/scripts/run-claude-review.sh` launcher. Never invoke the
raw `claude` CLI directly or hand-compose an equivalent command. Never supply
or override Claude's model, effort, permission, persistence, or output options;
the launcher owns those settings and pins literal `--effort low`. Do not set
`CLAUDE_REVIEW_CLI` outside launcher tests. A missing, incompatible, or failed
launcher is a blocker, not permission to fall back to the raw CLI.
The launcher also owns a 45-minute pass timeout. Operators may lower it with
`LOCAL_REVIEW_PASS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; values above the hard 3600-second ceiling
are rejected.

The contract-v4 `agent-loop` is the sole exception: its wrapper directly
invokes the separately tested
`.codex/skills/agent-loop/scripts/run-codex-review.sh`, which starts Claude with
the same pinned effort, permission, persistence, and output policy against an
immutable base-blob `.claude` snapshot. Interactive review and every
non-agent-loop caller continue to use `run-claude-review.sh` only.

### Select the local session mode

The local relay has two explicit session modes. A consumer may declare a default;
otherwise ask the user before the first cross-engine transition. Do not switch
modes silently in the middle of a round.

- **Auto mode** lets the outer controller run the complete bounded chain.
  Resolve the effective roster first and invoke each missing declared reviewer
  through its tested launcher;
  never change an in-flight roster implicitly. For a newly declared relay the
  default direct interactive reviewer engine is `gemini`, launched through the
  Agy CLI only via `.codex/skills/critique/scripts/run-agy-review.sh`. That
  launcher pins `gemini-3.7-flash-high`, literal `--effort high`, accept-edits
  mode, unattended permissions, structured output, and the same 30-minute
  default / 3600-second hard pass bound;
  callers cannot supply or override them. It also requires Agy to resolve the
  current `deepcritique` skill, resolves its real target, and validates a
  structurally compatible relay surface from a clean, exact-commit companion
  checkout before review. A consumer may explicitly retain Claude through the
  tested `run-claude-review.sh` launcher, which keeps its literal `--effort low`
  contract. Agy starts a fresh one-shot by omitting continuation flags, but the
  current CLI has no equivalent of Claude's `--no-session-persistence`; retain
  the Claude path when local conversation persistence is prohibited. Never
  hand-compose either CLI command. After the reviewer returns, validate its
  PR-head and ledger evidence before the outer controller decides whether to
  invoke another pass. Each launcher runs exactly one reviewer pass and must
  never start another reviewer, retry itself, or continue the relay. Continue
  until convergence or the tier cap. The separate `agent-loop` wrapper remains Codex-then-Claude
  until its fixed engine slots are migrated independently.
- **Handoff mode** never starts the other engine. Each nonterminal pass posts an
  authenticated `local-review-handoff:v1` PR comment and returns control to the
  user, who starts the requested reviewer in a new terminal session. Do not
  choose the other engine's model, effort, flags, or runtime settings.

In handoff mode, when the user says `continue review on PR <number>`, `resume
review`, or similar, use `local-review-handoff.py show-handoff` to load the latest
authenticated handoff in the current run. New handoffs bind their digest and
marker to that run; handoffs from older runs are historical context only. The
controller preserves unscoped handoffs only for legacy reviews with no run.
Continue only when it names the current engine and its exact head is still the
PR head. If it names the other engine, stop and ask the user to start that
engine in a fresh terminal.

1. Make the change, run focused validation, and create a clean local commit.
2. Push the feature branch and open or reuse its draft PR. Record the PR number,
   head SHA, and all existing review threads before any reviewer runs.
   Resolve the tier, place the user's bounded-run authorization in a private
   temporary file, and create the authenticated run marker before launching a
   pass:

   ```bash
   local-review-handoff.py start-run --repo <owner/repo> --pr <number> \
     --head <head-sha> --base <base-sha> --tier <lean|deep> \
     --authorization-file <private-file> --sequence <ordered-engines>
   ```

   Include the author and every declared reviewer in `<ordered-engines>`, using
   the user's chosen order where specified (for example `codex,claude`). This
   does not change the default reviewer selection above. Omit `--sequence` for
   an explicitly requested unsequenced or solo review, not for a full chain.

   When the target branch's effective GitHub rules require signed commits,
   `start-run` verifies GitHub's signature status for every commit introduced by
   the PR, not only its current head. `authorize-pass`, `post-handoff`, and a
   converged `finish-run` repeat that check so a later unsigned fix cannot pass
   through the relay. An unsigned or otherwise unverified commit stops before a
   reviewer budget is spent. Prepare signed replacement commits in an isolated
   worktree, prove their trees match, and obtain explicit approval for a
   lease-protected force-push before rewriting published history. Repositories
   whose effective target-branch rules accept unsigned commits are unchanged.
   The helper fixes the cap at two Lean rounds or four Deep rounds. A later run
   on the same PR requires the current run to be ended and a new, explicit user
   authorization passed with `--restart`; a new session alone is not a restart.
   For an alternating chain, select each pass with `next-pass` as described
   below. With the bundled ledger 1.4, attestation identities
   are scoped to the authenticated run: a newly authorized run starts at round
   1 without colliding with historical rounds. `authorize-pass` reports equal
   `round` and `run_round` values and enforces the two/four-round cap. Preserve
   earlier attestations; do not restart an active run to evade its remaining cap.

   Before upgrading an in-flight review from an older controller, finalize its
   saved results with its original pinned helper. Never renumber a sealed result.
   If an older PR-wide run cannot be completed, preserve its evidence and close
   it using `finish-run --outcome aborted`; starting a new run under 1.4 requires
   explicit authorization.

   The controller at `.codex/skills/critique/scripts/local-review-handoff.py`
   has no `status` or `resume-run` command. For legacy unsequenced runs, select one past this engine's
   highest completed round after the active run marker (1 when it has none),
   then validate it with `authorize-pass`. An aborted run stays terminal;
   an explicitly authorized restart is a new run with a full cap, not a
   budget-preserving resume.

3. Declare the roster with the ledger helper's `post-roster`, naming the author
   engine and this PR's reviewer engines. Participation is declared, never
   inferred: an engine that has not attested is otherwise indistinguishable from
   one that was never going to run, so nothing downstream can tell an incomplete
   round from a finished one. A solo relay is `--reviewers none` with the reason
   in the content file.
4. Fetch the target base, record its immutable commit SHA, and give that exact
   SHA to every reviewer for the round. No reviewer may re-resolve a mutable
   remote-tracking ref independently.
5. Run each declared reviewer in a fresh session against the current head. Read
   the PR ledger, post every confirmed finding inline before editing, fix,
   validate, commit, push, reply, and resolve. Codex's lane is
   `deepcritique <pr-number>` when Codex is the author engine and
   `pr-critique <pr-number>` when it is reviewing another engine's change; other
   engines use their own equivalents. In a sequenced run, use the engine and
   round returned by `next-pass`; otherwise reviewer order is a scheduling
   choice. Every attestation still names the exact commit that engine read.

   How the next reviewer starts is a mode choice, not a protocol rule. In auto
   mode the outer controller authorizes one pass, launches it through the
   roster-selected tested launcher, and reassesses after it returns. Handoff
   mode posts a handoff comment
   and stops, so the next reviewer begins in a fresh user-started terminal. Both
   modes carry the same comment/fix/reply/resolve contract, and neither changes
   which commit an attestation names.

6. Classify committed review fixes as `material` or `minor`. A material fix
   affects behavior, correctness, security/privacy, data safety, compatibility,
   deployment/sync integrity, or another substantive contract. Minor-only fixes
   are validated and kept.

   **The chain gets cheaper as it repeats.** Three rules make that happen, and
   all are derived from the ledger so a fresh session reaches the same answer:
   - **The refactor pass runs once per engine per PR.** A second cleanup pass over
     an already-simplified diff returns naming and shape churn, which moves the
     head and invalidates the other engines' attestations for nothing that ships.
     Each engine's cleanup lane latches on a `local-review-refactor:v1` marker;
     a docs/config-only skip does not consume it.
   - **A fix invalidates by head, not by position.** An attestation is evidence
     for the exact commit it names. A material fix does not restart the round at
     some first engine; it moves the head, which invalidates precisely those
     attestations that named the old head. An engine that already attested the
     post-fix commit stays valid and does not re-run. This is what keeps a
     second reviewer from costing a full extra round every time anything
     changes.
   - **Use the resolved tier's stance:** Lean round 1 is adversarial and round 2
     converges; Deep rounds 1–2 are adversarial and rounds 3–4 converge.
     The first pass after escalation remains adversarial regardless of ordinal.
     A reviewer holding no attestation on this PR runs adversarially on its
     first cold read whatever the round ordinal: the stance tracks how many
     times that reviewer has read the change, not how many rounds elapsed
     before it joined.
     After the tier's adversarial passes, the remaining
     findings are mostly about the review's own artifacts. A convergence round
     runs only the lanes that can find a reason not to deploy, changes the PR
     only for a realistically reachable blocking defect, defers everything else,
     creates an issue only for an urgent high-impact follow-up, and returns to
     the controller when clean for required exact-head coverage. Lanes still report everything they find —
     the narrowing is a disposition rule applied when consolidating lane output,
     never an instruction to a lane to withhold what it found.

7. Cap the loop at two Lean rounds or four Deep rounds. Before each manual
   pass, require `local-review-handoff.py authorize-pass` for its engine, exact
   base/head, and round. Only `run-claude-review.sh` and `run-agy-review.sh`
   perform this check themselves; a Codex leg and the `agent-loop` review hooks
   are bounded by `review_max_rounds` and the whole-run deadline instead, so do
   not assume a pass is budget-checked merely because it was launched.
   At cap exhaustion, stop, preserve the branch,
   worktree, and draft PR, and report non-convergence. Do not mark it ready.
8. A sequenced run must first reach `next-pass` status `converged`. Also require
   `verify-coverage` to pass at the exact current head — a roster
   is declared and every declared reviewer holds an attestation naming that
   head — the round that produced those attestations had no material fix, and
   every local-review thread contains a disposition reply and is resolved.
   Revalidate the exact PR head, then end the run with
   `local-review-handoff.py finish-run --outcome converged` and mark the PR
   ready. Record `exhausted` or `aborted` when those are the actual terminal
   outcomes. Never leave a terminal run open merely to permit another pass.

### Explicit alternating chains

A request for a full auto review chain means an outer orchestration loop, not
one local skill invocation or several subagent lanes from the same engine.
Resolve and report the engine sequence, tier, per-engine cap, mode, and tested
launcher paths before spending a pass. Preserve a user-specified sequence.
For Codex → Claude Code → Codex, start with `--sequence codex,claude`;
the controller repeats that cycle and requires a return to Codex before stopping.
The author engine is a required participant when named in the sequence, even
though it does not count as an independent reviewer in the roster. Do not
change authorship or shrink the roster to make coverage pass.

Before each leg, run:

```bash
python3 .codex/skills/critique/scripts/local-review-handoff.py next-pass \
  --repo <owner/repo> --pr <number> --head <exact-head-sha>
```

For `status: next`, pass the returned engine and per-engine round to
`authorize-pass`. Run the current engine's review skill locally; launch Claude
only with `.codex/skills/critique/scripts/run-claude-review.sh`. Same-engine
subagents are lanes, not another engine. A missing or failed tested launcher
blocks that leg; preserve the requested chain and report the gap. A launcher
return is not evidence: require its authenticated attestation before advancing.

In handoff mode, use the returned next engine as `post-handoff --to-engine`,
not necessarily the author. Supply the last completed pass as the handoff's
from-engine, round, head, and outcome. A terminal sequence has no next handoff.

`next-pass` derives completed passes only from the current authenticated run.
It requires ordered participation, a return to the initiating engine, and every
participant's latest attestation on the current head with no material outcome.
`finish-run --outcome converged` additionally runs `verify-ledger` and
`verify-coverage`; neither a green test suite nor coverage alone replaces the
sequence check. Report `exhausted` at the tier cap and leave the PR draft.
Existing unsequenced runs are not silently upgraded: preserve them or obtain
explicit authorization to end and restart with a sequence.

At handoff or completion, report the ordered engine/round/head/outcome evidence,
per-engine pass counts, validation performed, and the actual terminal status.
Distinguish reviewer passes from subagent lanes and from full cycles; never
report an attempted or failed launch as a completed round.

### One publication per wrapper pass

When `$AGENT_LOOP_REVIEW_PUSH_HELPER` is set, the pass runs under the wrapper
and `review-push.sh` permits **exactly one** publication for it. That overrides
the per-finding publish cadence in
[`references/local-review-ledger.md`](references/local-review-ledger.md)
"Fix, reply, and resolve", whose step 2 reads as one helper call per finding:
here, apply every fix the pass will make, commit them, and call the helper once.
A cleanup lane running inside the same pass commits locally and does not publish
for itself.

The ledger's ordering contract is unchanged — each finding is still posted
inline before it is edited, and each thread still gets its own disposition reply
naming the fix SHA. Only the number of pushes changes: the second helper call in
a pass exits with "review-push permits only one publication per reviewer pass"
and aborts the pass mid-fix.

The author engine's own adversarial pass never counts toward coverage. It
re-reads the change while still holding the rationale that produced it, which is
the opposite of the cold read the relay exists to obtain. `coverage` reports it
as `authorAttested` so the fact stays visible, but the tier counts distinct
non-author engines only.

The `agent-loop` skill automates a two-engine instance of this relay with a
required non-mutating validation hook plus `review_max_rounds`,
`codex_review_hook`, and `claude_review_hook`. It still encodes a fixed
Codex-then-Claude order and a position-based restart rather than the head rule
above; that is deliberate for now, and the roster and head-exact rules do not
yet reach it. Under contract v3 and v4 every hook writes a structured clean,
changed, or blocked result to `$AGENT_LOOP_REVIEW_RESULT_FILE`. The wrapper
validates that result against observed Git state and the v3 ledger, then posts
the canonical pass/completion attestation itself. It opens a draft PR before
review, exports the pinned PR identity to both hooks, checkpoints private atomic
run state, and verifies that each hook leaves local, remote, and PR heads
aligned. Consumer hooks own semantic finding verification, deterministic inline
posting and disposition, and classification; they must fail or return blocked
if a valid finding or undisposed local-review thread remains.

An automated wrapper must make its mode explicit. Contract-v3/v4 auto mode requires
`config_doctor = true` and `claude_effort_policy = low`; for v3 the doctor
requires exactly one literal `--effort low` option in the Claude hook, while for
v4 it verifies the pinned launcher's effort-policy query before selection or
claim. Handoff mode stops after each nonterminal engine leg and uses the same
PR-comment protocol as an interactive review.

## Cross-Engine Session Handoff

This section is engine-specific and lives here rather than in the vendored
protocol document, which stays byte-identical across every engine.

### Post the handoff at the end of a pass

In handoff mode, never start another reviewer from the current session. At the
end of a pass, post a deterministic PR comment carrying the exact base, current
head, completed engine and round, outcome, next reviewer, and a pasteable
fresh-session prompt:

```bash
python3 .codex/skills/critique/scripts/local-review-handoff.py post-handoff \
  --repo <owner/repo> --pr <number> --head <full-head-sha> \
  --base <full-base-sha> --from-engine <engine> \
  --to-engine <engine> --round <completed-round> \
  --outcome <clean|minor|material|blocked> \
  [--context-file <public-safe-regular-utf8-file>]
```

The helper owns the `local-review-handoff:v1` marker and prompt. It verifies the
PR head before and after posting, verifies the comment read-back, rejects marker
injection from optional context, and makes an identical retry idempotent.

### Read the prior pass before every review

Before running any lane, read what the other engines already left at this head.
This is unconditional: it does not depend on the session mode, and it does not
depend on the user having said "continue" or "resume". A reviewer that starts
cold re-derives findings another engine already posted inline, which is the
expensive failure this read exists to prevent.

**The ledger attestation is the authority.** Every
`local-review-pass:v3` / `local-review-complete:v3` marker on the PR carries the
engine, round, base, before and final head, the classification, and the full
finding-fingerprint set of the pass that produced it. Read those markers, their
bodies, and the inline v3 threads they name. Do not re-litigate a fingerprint
another engine dispositioned at this head. `coverage` and `verify-coverage`
report the same state mechanically.

`local-review-handoff:v1` is a Codex-side enrichment on top of that record, not
a substitute for it and not a precondition. **Never refuse to start because no
handoff comment exists** — an engine that does not implement this protocol never
writes one, so its absence carries no information about whether the previous
pass ran. Where one is present it is the
richer read:

```bash
python3 .codex/skills/critique/scripts/local-review-handoff.py show-handoff \
  --repo <owner/repo> --pr <number> --engine <engine>
```

The helper considers the latest handoff from the authenticated GitHub actor,
verifies its content digest and exact live PR head, and fails if the comment
targets another engine. Never fall back to an older handoff addressed to the
current engine. A failure that means "targets the other engine" is a genuine
stop; a failure that means "none found" is not.

A handoff records who runs next; it is not evidence of review. Coverage still
comes from attestations naming the exact head, so a handoff neither creates nor
invalidates one.

## Recover a blocked pass

Before interrupting a running reviewer for an apparent posting-order violation,
read the installed skill for its active phase. A local cleanup commit ahead of
the PR, or a latch not yet posted, can be expected before the enclosing pass's
single publication. Older skills also allowed cleanup without inline findings;
that instruction mismatch is not proof that the reviewer ignored its contract.
Reconcile at the phase's publication/result boundary. Current cleanup must have
fixed finding evidence; neither a commit title nor a latch can replace it.
If evidence is genuinely missing, preserve the work and use supported recovery;
never fabricate a prior finding or certify an incomplete pass.

A reviewer returns one pass; the auto controller owns the remaining authorized
work. A valid blocked result is not a clean attestation, but it is not by itself
a failed launcher or a reason to end the whole run.

Read the blocker and reconcile local, remote, and PR heads plus the complete
thread ledger. Then choose the next action from evidence:

- For a reachable code defect with an authorized fix, apply the smallest
  correction, validate, push, and dispose its existing finding. Continue only
  the missing exact-head reviewers within the remaining run budget.
- For incomplete bookkeeping, use the installed helper's supported recovery
  flow in [Recover interrupted reviews](references/local-review-ledger.md#recover-interrupted-reviews).
  Preserve the original result and pre-pass snapshot. Finalization cannot turn
  a blocked result into completed review evidence.
- For identity conflicts, unknown mutation outcomes, unsupported recovery, or
  a launcher failure, reconcile or report the precise unresolved boundary.
  Retry uncertain writes only with the same idempotent operation. A known
  preflight rejection that performed no write may be corrected and retried.
  Keep the tested launcher and ledger invariants intact.

Decide finding severity and intended disposition before posting. Reserve
`blocking` for a defect that must be fixed or disproved before this PR can
proceed. A planned follow-up is not a blocking disposition; evaluate its
reachability, scope, and severity first. If an existing blocker was mistaken,
record the evidence through the helper's supported disposition path. Dismiss
only an invalid claim; never edit a marker or use dismissal to hide a real
deferred blocker. An unavailable severity-amendment operation is not needed
when the authorized code fix can resolve the finding instead.

Ask for a decision only when the next action needs authority, information, or
risk acceptance the user has not supplied. Keep the run active while recovery
can progress; close it when it actually converges, exhausts its cap, or reaches
an unresolved terminal boundary. Recovery does not reset the round budget.

## Hosted Reviewers

Hosted AI reviewers — the Gemini Flash and Copilot passes `reviewit` drives on
the PR itself — are a **different style of review**, not a fallback and not a
later phase. Run one whenever it is useful: before the relay, between rounds,
after convergence, or as the only review on a change that does not warrant a
local relay.

**The local relay is the default path here.** Coverage is expected to come from
declared roster engines reading the change cold, and that is what
`verify-coverage` measures. The hosted lane is an extension on top of that.

It stays fully supported because it is the primary path for a consumer whose
developers have no local agent engine — a repository with no local CLI and no
declared roster still gets real review from a hosted pass. That is the case the
lane exists for; it is not the case these defaults are tuned for.

A repository with no local engine has no roster, so `verify-coverage` does not
apply to it. There, convergence is the hosted lane's own contract: every hosted
finding disposed and resolved, and a final iteration that produced no fix. A
roster-less PR converges on that rule and must not claim relay coverage.

A hosted pass **invalidates nothing on its own.** Only a commit invalidates, and
only by the head rule in step 6, which treats a hosted-review fix exactly like
any other:

- a minor fix leaves attestations at the old head stale for the ordinary reason,
  and the affected engines re-run when the relay next needs them;
- a material fix means the round had a material transition and does not
  converge, the same as if a local reviewer had made it.

Classify a hosted-review fix by its effect on the code, with the same
material/minor rule as everything else. "A hosted reviewer touched this" is not
a category.

Hosted reviewers are not roster participants. They post under their own
identities, so their comments are context rather than actor-owned ledger
evidence, and they do not attest. Coverage counts local engines only — a hosted
pass does not turn a solo relay into a cross-model one.

Invocation:

- **Lean** — `reviewit <pr-number>` for the bounded Gemini Flash and Copilot
  loop. It verifies and deduplicates their findings, fixes confirmed issues,
  pushes, replies, and loops within its cap. Run it after
  `refactorpass <pr-number>` and `critique <pr-number>` when the local relay is
  also running.
- **Deep** — `reviewit <pr-number> deep`, with the larger cap and early-exit
  rules. Its final local `deepcritique` receives the same PR number and ledger,
  and skips the refactor pass when this engine's cleanup latch is already spent
  on the PR.

## Finding severity

Rate findings by the behavior and people affected, using the same four levels
in every engine and lens:

- **blocking**: ships materially wrong behavior, loses or corrupts data, exposes
  a credible security/privacy exploit, breaks a public contract, or breaks rollout.
- **major**: a reachable defect with a concrete user or operator consequence
  that does not meet the blocking bar.
- **minor**: a limited defect or improvement with no material behavioral consequence.
- **nit**: style or preference, with no defect.

Severity describes a finding; pass classification describes the effect of its
fix. Apply the classification rules in the packaged ledger protocol separately.
Instructions and tests can affect review integrity, so their file type alone
does not determine severity or classification.

## Review Tier

Resolve the tier **before the first reviewer runs**, on every path. An
unresolved tier is not a neutral state — it is how the expensive path becomes
the default. **Lean is the default; Deep is the exception you justify.**

State the resolved tier and the trigger that selected it — or `no trigger` — in
the pass output, and post the ledger's `local-review-tier:v1` marker once per
PR. The marker is per-PR and shared across engines: later rounds resolve the
effective marker under the ledger's authenticated, forward-only transition rule
instead of reclassifying the unchanged range. A tier re-derived from scratch
each round, or re-derived against a different list in each engine, drifts back
to Deep.

### What sets the tier

Tier is set by what a missed defect reaches, not by how hard the change is to
review. Difficulty is the wrong input: every subtle diff feels like it deserves
more scrutiny, and that feeling is what pulls a whole repo onto the deep path.

Resolve the changed-file list once with
`git diff --name-only <base-sha>..<head-sha>`, then walk the triggers below.
**Any one selects Deep; no trigger means Lean.**

1. **Sensitive path** — authentication, authorization, cryptography, secret or
   credential handling, PHI/PII, tenant or customer isolation. Evaluate the
   bounded-repair exception below before selecting this trigger.
2. **Irreversible in production data or a published artifact** — migration,
   backfill, a published package's API or version: anything a revert cannot
   undo.
3. **Fans out past this repo** — the synced `.codex/**` surface, the sync
   engine, a published package, a contract other repositories consume. One
   defect lands in every consumer.
4. **Non-obvious behaviour in deployed runtime code** — concurrency, retries or
   idempotency, cache invalidation, money or clinical calculation, state
   machines, partial-failure and rollback paths: correctness that is not
   readable from the diff.
5. **Recurring-incident area** — the touched paths produced a post-merge defect,
   revert, or hotfix in roughly the last 90 days. Evidence is a specific defect,
   revert, or hotfix commit you can name; an active path with ordinary commit
   traffic is not evidence.
6. **Explicitly requested** — a human directly asked for a deep review.
   Novelty alone does not select this trigger; assess the actual risk under
   triggers 1–5. An internal
   `deep` argument passed between tier-aware skills only asserts the recorded
   tier; it is not a new request.

### Bounded repairs

A narrow repair may remain Lean even on a sensitive path when it removes an
unsafe operation or restores an established invariant using existing controls,
without changing authorization, cryptography, tenant isolation, persistence,
public contracts, or the control's accepted value shapes. Verify the affected
call site and regression coverage; include the security and test lenses where
applicable. For example, replacing a sensitive log value with a constant or a
boolean passed through an existing type-restricted sanitizer can qualify.

This is an exception to trigger 1, not an exemption from risk review. Evaluate
triggers 2–6 independently. For trigger 5, the original defect being repaired is
not by itself evidence of repeated failed fixes; a recurring regression or a
separate recent defect in the same behavior still counts. A new sanitizer, a
broadened allowlist value shape, or an unproven boundary change remains Deep.
Record why the exception applies. Small line count alone is not that evidence.
The exception fails closed: when it is unclear whether a change stays inside
it, it does not, and trigger 1 stands.

### What does not set the tier

Subtlety does not: a change can be hard to reason about and still be Lean. Nor
does diff size — a large mechanical refactor is Lean unless it also trips
trigger 4. Nor does topic adjacency: code _about_ security that does not itself
enforce a sensitive boundary is not trigger 1.

**The dominant rule: when the worst outcome of a missed defect is a red CI run,
a broken build, or a broken developer workflow, the change is Lean.** CI
scripts, lint rules, build tooling, developer utilities, fixtures, and test
harnesses land here even when they are subtle and even when a defect in them
fails open. That class of defect is caught by the next person the tool touches
and fixed by editing the tool.

Classify enforcement controls by the consequence of failure, not by their CI
location. A secret/privacy scanner, provenance gate, or release guard is Deep
when failing open can expose protected data, grant access, or compromise a
published artifact; that outcome trips trigger 1 or 2 rather than this rule.

**Precedence: walk triggers 1–6 first. The dominant rule only resolves a change
that matched no trigger.** It is dominant over the difficulty instinct, not over
the trigger list. Tooling that also fans out past this repo — the sync engine, a
shared CI action, anything under `.codex/` — is trigger 3 and therefore Deep,
because its blast radius is not confined to the developer who runs it.

### Round budget and stopping rule

A round is one complete pass per available engine at the same head.

- **Lean — cap 2.** Round 1 is adversarial. Round 2 runs only if round 1 made a
  material fix, and runs in convergence mode.
- **Deep — cap 4.** Rounds 1–2 adversarial, rounds 3–4 convergence.

**Stop as soon as a complete round produces no material fix.** That is the
stopping rule for both tiers, and it is a rule rather than a budget to spend: a
Lean change that lands after one clean round has had enough review.

A Lean change that reaches round 3 has either been mis-tiered — escalate it
deliberately, below — or is not converging, which is a signal about the change
rather than a licence for another round. Say which, and stop.

### Escalate and de-escalate on evidence

Resolve the initial classification, including the bounded-repair exception,
before starting a run. A tentative Deep guess is not a reason to spend a Deep
pass: inspect the actual delta and record the justified tier first. For an
existing run, use the evidence-based transitions below and the installed
controller's supported recovery flow; preserve findings and consumed rounds.
This policy does not add a tier-amendment command or authorize a budget reset.
An explicit human request for Deep remains in force until the human revises it;
internal launcher arguments and "continue in auto" do not create that request.

After a justified classification, escalation and de-escalation follow the
evidence rules below. Suspicion or an unverified severity label does not move a tier.

**Lean → Deep.** Escalate when a confirmed finding shows the change reaches a
trigger the classification missed — a real authorization or isolation bypass, a
real data-shape change, a real break in a contract another repository consumes —
or when the human directly requests Deep, which is trigger 6. Name the finding
or request and the trigger, post a replacement tier marker that preserves every
recorded trigger and adds the new one, and adopt the Deep budget. The round
already run counts as Deep round 1; do not restart the count.
**The first round after an escalation is adversarial whatever its ordinal.**

**Deep → Lean.** De-escalate when Deep round 1 completes and _every_ lane owning
a recorded trigger returned no confirmed finding. Finish at Lean: the lean lane
set, one further round at most. Running the full matrix again over a
substantively unchanged diff audits the review rather than the change. Record
the de-escalation and the lanes that came back clean.

Trigger 6 — an explicitly requested deep review — is never de-escalated by a reviewer alone. The
request is the evidence, and no clean lane overrides it. For the rest, a trigger
de-escalates only through the lane that owns it:

| Trigger                          | Owning lane                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1 sensitive path                 | security reviewer                         |
| 2 irreversible data or artifact  | code reviewer (migration/compat pass)     |
| 3 fans out past this repo        | code reviewer on the consumed contract    |
| 4 non-obvious deployed behaviour | silent failure hunter + code reviewer     |
| 5 recurring-incident area        | code reviewer scoped to the incident path |
| 6 explicitly requested           | not de-escalatable                        |

Tier selection narrows which lanes run and how many rounds are owed. It never
narrows what a lane may report, and it never relaxes the post-before-editing,
reply, or resolve contract.

`deepcritique` runs only on a resolved Deep tier and hands a Lean changeset back
to `critique`; typing the deep skill does not select the deep path. `reviewit`'s
iteration cap matches the tier's round cap numerically — two at Lean, four at
Deep.

## Skip Path

For docs/config-only changes, skip expensive review automation unless the user
explicitly wants it. Source-code changes include common implementation
extensions such as `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.py`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.java`,
`.cpp`, `.c`, `.h`, `.cs`, `.rb`, `.swift`, `.kt`, `.sh`, and `.bash`.

## Reviewing Another Engine's Change

When Codex holds the reviewer role, run `pr-critique <pr-number>` from an
isolated worktree. It reads the existing ledger, reviews at the resolved tier, posts
confirmed findings inline, applies fixes, and completes those same threads.

If that pass commits a fix, it moves the head and invalidates the attestations
that named the old commit — including the author engine's. Those engines re-run
against the new head; engines that had not yet attested are unaffected. The
hand-back is the head rule, not a separate obligation.

## Pass Telemetry

At the pass boundary, create and save this pass's idempotency key:

```bash
node .codex/skills/critique/scripts/telemetry-pass-key.js \
  <owner/repo> <pr> <controller-run-id-or-standalone> <authenticated-actor> \
  <engine> <review-or-refactor-or-hosted> <round> <reviewed-head>
```

Use the controller's authenticated run ID when present. `standalone` creates
a fresh attempt identity; invoke it once and retain its returned key in the
pass's private working files. Pass `--idempotency-key <returned-key>` to every
emission, reusing it on a retry. Different actors and restarted runs must not
share keys. Never regenerate a standalone key to retry publication. If key
creation fails, report telemetry failure rather than falling back to a key
that may identify a different pass. This works with existing ledger bundles.

Every pass records what it cost, as a `local-review-telemetry:v1` marker in its
own PR comment. The record carries token buckets per exact model, classified
line churn, finding dispositions, and the pass identity needed to ask whether
Deep earns its cost. This engine reports its prompt side as one figure with the
cached and cache-write portions inside it, so the helper subtracts them to reach
the disjoint canonical buckets and keeps the reported figure alongside as a
provider bucket — that arithmetic is what makes an `input` count here mean the
same thing it means for another engine.

The record carries no prose, no file paths, no finding titles, and no money:
rates move and a subscription's marginal cost is zero, so a stored dollar figure
is wrong when written and unverifiable later. Counts keep the whole series
re-priceable.

### Two gates: measuring and publishing

Repository defaults come from the synced sibling `review-telemetry.json` beside
this harness's usage helper. Non-empty process environment values override
those defaults. Missing configuration enables publication and extraction; malformed
configuration disables both gates with an error. See `docs/sync.md` upstream
for the required sync destinations.

Extraction and emission are separate decisions and have separate gates. Both
are read by the usage helper and nowhere else; both are environment
configuration set once, never an interactive prompt during a pass, because a
prompt would block an autonomous run.

| Variable                        | Governs                             | Default           |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `LOOM_REVIEW_TELEMETRY`         | emitting a record to a pull request | on                |
| `LOOM_REVIEW_TELEMETRY_EXTRACT` | measuring this pass at all          | the emission gate |

Each accepts exactly `on` or `off`. Any other non-empty value is neither: the
helper stays disabled and says why, so a typo reads as a misconfiguration
rather than as a deliberate opt-out.

Publication defaults on for every review pass. Set `telemetry.emit: off` in the
consumer's sync configuration — not in the rendered `review-telemetry.json`,
whose only keys are the two variables named above — or set
`LOOM_REVIEW_TELEMETRY=off` in the process environment to opt out. Extraction inherits emission unless explicitly set,
so an emission opt-out also disables extraction by default. For local-only
measurement, set `LOOM_REVIEW_TELEMETRY_EXTRACT=on` with emission off.

The helper reports `enabled` for extraction and `emit` for emission on every
payload, in every mode and on every failure path. **Invoke `emit-telemetry`
only when `emit` is true**, and never derive that from anything else.

### Never read a telemetry marker

A pass must not read prior telemetry: not into a finder prompt, not into a
review packet, not into context assembly, not into a summary of the PR. An
agent that can see its own measured cost and a readable trend has been handed a
target, and the thing it can most easily optimise is the review rather than the
spend. Reporting **this** pass's own numbers at the end, after findings are
posted, is fine — a single figure with no baseline is not a trend.

Filter by the `local-review-telemetry:` prefix rather than by a list of known
markers, so a record type added later is excluded by default instead of leaking
into reviewer context until someone teaches the filter about it.

### Snapshot before, delta after

`<usage-helper>` is `.codex/skills/critique/scripts/usage-snapshot.js`, beside
the vendored ledger helper and invoked the same way. It binds the coordinator
to the host-provided session ID and includes new descendant sessions spawned by
that coordinator during the pass; the ledger helper never reads session logs,
and never may.

Write telemetry working files to `$AGENT_LOOP_LOG_DIR/telemetry/` when that
variable is set, or to another owner-only directory outside the Git worktree.

Before the first reviewer, cleanup agent, or classification read — early enough
that the pass's own setup counts as part of its cost:

```bash
node <usage-helper> snapshot --out "<telemetry-dir>/usage-start.json"
```

After the pass has finalized its v3 result, and after any fix commits:

```bash
node <usage-helper> delta \
  --start "<telemetry-dir>/usage-start.json" --out-dir "<telemetry-dir>"
```

`delta` prints `enabled`, `emit`, `tokenSource`, nullable `engineVersion`,
nullable `durationSeconds`, and the paths it wrote. This engine reports no per-lane
attribution, so `lanesFile` is always null and `lanes` is absent from the record
rather than empty. Pass non-null values through verbatim and omit their flags
when null. `tokenSource` is the provenance of the numbers and must never be
upgraded by hand:

- `session-log-delta` — measured, scoped to this pass.
- `unscoped-session` — measured, but a truthful upper bound rather than this
  pass's cost. A standalone pass with no start snapshot lands here.
- `unavailable` — no usable data, and the record carries **no** token buckets.

**A pass with no usable usage data must never emit zero tokens.** A zero makes
the engine look free and skews every average in its favour, and it is the kind
of defect that survives a year because the dashboard still looks plausible.
Aggregation excludes a missing measurement; nothing zero-fills it.

### Identify the prompt stack

A record that says what a pass cost but not what it was running cannot answer
"did that prompt change help" — findings-per-token is a property of the prompt
as much as of the model. `<hash-helper>` is
`.codex/skills/critique/scripts/prompt-stack-hash.js`. Run it once per pass,
any time after the boundary and before emission:

```bash
node <hash-helper> --repo-root "<repository root>"
```

It reads only files already checked into the repository — no session log, no
path under a home directory — so it is ungated and safe to run anywhere. It
always exits 0 and always prints one JSON object carrying `promptStackSha256`,
`promptStackVersion`, `repoInstructionsSha256`, and `hashInputVersion`. Pass the
two digests and the version through verbatim — `--prompt-stack-sha256`,
`--repo-instructions-sha256`, `--prompt-stack-version` — and omit the
corresponding flag when one is null. Nothing else it prints is an
`emit-telemetry` argument.

A null `promptStackVersion` alongside a null `promptStackSha256` is the helper
saying it could not read the stack declaration, and `error` says why. Do not
substitute a version from anywhere else: the point of the field is that it came
from the prompts the pass actually loaded.

**The two digests are never collapsed into one.** The synced stack is
fleet-wide and moves when upstream moves; repo-local instructions are per
repository. A combined digest would make every repository look like a different
prompt generation forever, which destroys the cross-repository correlation the
hash exists to enable.

#### Hash input, version 2

The digest input is a definition, not an implementation detail. Two engines
that hashed the same stack in different orders would mint two identities for
one prompt generation, which reads downstream as a real difference and is worse
than having no hash. Version 2 is:

- **Prompt stack** — the files named by `.codex/prompt-stack.json`, the manifest
  synced in beside this harness's prompts. It is a build output of the
  repository that owns them, which knows exactly what it shipped; a declaration
  naming a file that repository does not have fails its render rather than
  reading here as an absent file. This is still an enumerated declaration and
  still not a glob — what changed in version 2 is who writes it down. Version 1
  carried the list in the helper, so two engine copies of one script had to keep
  agreeing on its membership and its byte order forever, enforced by nothing.
  Which files a harness declares, and why scripts and unloaded roles are
  excluded, is documented with the declaration upstream. The manifest is read
  only when it declares this harness's own root and a schema this helper
  recognises; anything else abstains, because a digest computed over a misread
  declaration is a different stack's digest wearing this one's name.
- **Repo instructions** — root `AGENTS.md` and root `CLAUDE.md`, both declared
  for both engines so the same repository state yields the same digest whichever
  engine emitted the record. Nested instruction files are out of scope: their
  discovery depends on which directories a pass happened to touch.
- **Order** — paths sorted byte-wise, computed from the set rather than taken
  from the order the list is written in.
- **Normalisation** — a leading UTF-8 BOM is stripped and CRLF and lone CR
  become LF, so a checkout with `core.autocrlf` on holds the same prompt
  generation as one without. Nothing else is normalised: trailing whitespace
  and blank-line changes are real edits to a prompt and must move the digest.
- **Framing** — the digest is taken over per-file digests, each record carrying
  its path, prefixed by a domain string that names the hash-input version and
  which set it is. A rename is a change, a file moved between the two sets
  cannot collide, and no byte can be shifted across a file boundary unnoticed.
- **Absence** — a declared file that is absent is recorded as absent rather than
  skipped, so a consumer that opted out or drifted has a visibly different
  identity. A set with nothing present at all yields null, not the digest of
  "everything absent".
- **Failure** — a declared file that exists and cannot be read yields null for
  that whole digest. Never a partial hash: one covering part of the stack is
  indistinguishable from one covering all of it.

The version is mixed into the digest rather than reported beside it, so a later
redefinition cannot silently rewrite the meaning of records already emitted —
version 3 would produce different digests by construction. Changing where the
file list comes from, the order, the normalisation, or the framing **is** a
redefinition and bumps it. Changing the _contents_ of the declared list is not:
that is a prompt-stack change, which is what the digest exists to report.

**Reading the series across the version 1 → 2 boundary.** By construction, an
unchanged prompt stack has a different digest either side of a redefinition, so
a consumer comparing digests over time sees one discontinuity that is not a
prompt change. The record carries no field naming which definition produced a
digest, so for this boundary use the one already in the data:
`promptStackVersion` is null in every record emitted before version 2 — nothing
computed it — and a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` string accompanies every successfully
computed digest after. For a record carrying `promptStackSha256`, a null version
therefore means a version 1 digest; null version plus null digest is an
abstention whose `error` states the reason. Version 1 and version 2 digests are
never comparable.
This discriminator is specific to this boundary and is not a general mechanism:
a third definition would need the ledger to carry the hash-input version
itself.

`hashInputVersion` is not `promptStackVersion`. The first versions _how the
digest was taken_; the second versions _the prompts_, is set upstream in
`PROMPT_STACK_VERSION`, and travels in the manifest. Both are needed and neither
substitutes for the other: a digest identifies a prompt generation exactly but
does not order two of them, so "did findings-per-token improve after that prompt
change" needs the version to say which generation came first. The version is
reported beside the digest and never mixed into it — a version bump that changed
no prompt must not move the digest, and a prompt edit must move it whether or not
anyone remembered to bump the version.

The sync protocol pin (`sync-v1`) is not this version either. That tag is
force-moved whenever content changes, so two consumers "on sync-v1" at different
times are running different prompts and the tag carries no content identity.

### Count the findings

Before every emission attempt, including `clean`, `changed`, `skipped`, and
`blocked` exits, write this pass's complete findings object to an owner-only
regular file and pass its path as `--findings-file`. This step also applies to
early returns before the normal end-of-pass sequence and to a spent cleanup
latch. Never omit the file or reuse a previous pass's measurements.

Use the all-zero object below only when this pass is known to have posted or
dispositioned no findings and introduced no chain-induced regressions. Status
alone does not establish zero: a blocked pass may have posted findings before
it failed, and a clean pass may have deferred or dismissed findings. Preserve
those actual counts. Include posted threads whose disposition is still pending
in `posted`; count only completed dispositions in the outcome buckets. Do not
invent a `validDeferred` disposition to make the totals equal.

If any required finding count is unknown, re-derive it from this pass's own
finding threads and dispositions on the pull request before doing anything
else. That ledger is the source of truth for `posted` and for the completed
outcome buckets, so "unknown" is a property of a failed query, not of what the
pass happens to remember. Declaring the measurement unavailable without
attempting it is the cheapest exit from this section and the one that costs the
record, so it is not available.

Only when that re-derivation itself fails: do not fabricate zeros or send an
incomplete file. Report `telemetry not emitted: findings measurement
unavailable`, naming which count could not be established, do not invoke
`emit-telemetry`, and return through the existing nonfatal telemetry path.
Missing token usage is separate: it does not prevent emission when findings
counts are known.

Write this pass's own dispositions to a regular file with the active
file-editing tool — never a heredoc or command substitution:

```json
{
  "posted": 0,
  "bySeverityAndOutcome": {
    "blocking": { "validFixed": 0, "validDeferred": 0, "invalidDismissed": 0 },
    "major": { "validFixed": 0, "validDeferred": 0, "invalidDismissed": 0 },
    "minor": { "validFixed": 0, "validDeferred": 0, "invalidDismissed": 0 },
    "nit": { "validFixed": 0, "validDeferred": 0, "invalidDismissed": 0 }
  },
  "chainInducedRegressions": 0
}
```

Count only threads this pass posted or dispositioned, and keep `posted`
greater than or equal to the sum of every disposition: the emitter checks that
and refuses the record otherwise. A pass that dispositions a thread an earlier
pass posted — fixing a deferred finding, say — therefore counts it in `posted`
as well, so the record stays internally consistent. `chainInducedRegressions`
counts new fingerprints whose diff anchor traces via `git blame` to a commit
recorded as a fix SHA in an earlier disposition **on this PR** — rework the
chain caused itself, which is far more expensive than either a finding or a
clean pass. A `reopen-occurrence` is not one of these: that is the same defect
still present, not a new one the chain introduced.

### Emit the record

```bash
node <ledger-helper> emit-telemetry \
  --repo <owner/repo> --pr <number> --engine codex \
  --base <full-base-sha> --head <full-head-sha> \
  --pass-type <review|refactor> --review-tier <lean|deep> \
  --trigger <autonomous|interactive> --round <n> \
  --stance <adversarial|convergence> --status <clean|changed|blocked|skipped> \
  --token-source <from delta> --engine-version <from delta> \
  --duration-seconds <from delta> \
  --tokens-file <from delta> \
  --prompt-stack-sha256 <from hash helper> \
  --prompt-stack-version <from hash helper> \
  --repo-instructions-sha256 <from hash helper> \
  --findings-file <path>
```

**Skip this step entirely when the helper reports `emit: false`.** A pass that
emitted anyway would post a telemetry record on a repository that opted out.
There is nothing to publish when the emission gate is off, whatever extraction
did.

`emit: true` with `enabled: false` — extraction switched off on a repository
that still publishes — is a legitimate combination. The helper reports
`tokenSource: unavailable` itself and the record carries no usage; pass that
through like any other value rather than repairing the gap by hand.

Omit `--engine-version`, `--duration-seconds`, and `--tokens-file` whenever
`delta` reported the corresponding value as null, and
`--prompt-stack-sha256` / `--prompt-stack-version` /
`--repo-instructions-sha256` whenever the hash helper did.
Omit `--changeset-file` and the classifier runs over `<base>..<head>` itself.
Add `--truncated` when a lane silently truncated the diff it was given: a lane
that reviewed less than it was asked to produces cheap, bad findings, which is
the exact pattern that otherwise reads as efficiency.

`trigger` is `autonomous` when a runner set the `AGENT_LOOP_*` variables and
`interactive` otherwise.

### What each pass emits

| Pass                                  | `--pass-type`      | `--status` |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Adversarial pass, nothing to fix      | `review`           | `clean`    |
| Adversarial pass that committed a fix | `review`           | `changed`  |
| Pass that could not complete          | `review`           | `blocked`  |
| Docs/config-only skip                 | matching pass-type | `skipped`  |
| Cleanup pass that committed           | `refactor`         | `changed`  |
| Cleanup pass that found nothing       | `refactor`         | `clean`    |
| Cleanup skipped on a spent latch      | `refactor`         | `clean`    |

A skip still burns tokens reading and classifying the PR, and "we spent eight
thousand tokens deciding not to review" is exactly the machinery overhead worth
seeing. `skipped` is reserved for the changeset that had nothing reviewable in
it — the record rejects a `skipped` pass carrying review-significant files, so a
cleanup pass that stopped on a spent latch reports `clean` instead. Its
changeset was reviewable; this engine had simply already spent its one pass.

### Emission failure is never fatal

`emit-telemetry` exits zero either way and prints `emitted` with the reason on
failure. Report that outcome and move on. Never retry it into the review, never
let it change the v3 result, and never let it delay marking the PR ready. This
is why the record is a separate marker in a separate comment rather than an
extension of the attestation, whose body is byte-verified and hash-checked: a
telemetry defect must not fail a review that found real defects.

## Review Principles

- Treat every generated finding as a hypothesis. Verify it against code, tests,
  and documented constraints before posting or changing anything.
- Fix a confirmed finding only when the likelihood and impact of real user harm,
  or a credible path to security exploitation, justify the fix's churn and
  regression risk.
- Create a follow-up issue only for a concrete, high-impact defect that should
  be scheduled within roughly two weeks. Record ordinary deferrals without an
  issue; do not turn speculative hardening, cleanup, or low-likelihood edge cases
  into backlog.
- A review fix without a preceding inline finding, a finding without a reply,
  or a resolved thread without a visible disposition is a failed review pass.
- Never copy sensitive source, credentials, private data, or model logs into PR
  metadata. Only the concise verified finding and its disposition belong there.
- Stop at the configured cap and preserve recovery state when reviewers do not
  converge.
