# Backlog-refinement learnings

> Append-only RCA log. Every `/agent-loop` bail or non-code PR failure produces an entry here via `/backlog-refinement rca`. Each entry sharpens a [`RUBRIC.md`](./RUBRIC.md) §2 transformation, a §3 disqualifier, or an `agent-loop-instructions.md` line. See the entry template in `SKILL.md`.
>
> **This file was bootstrapped from a starter template** and is consumer-owned (`create_if_missing: true`). It accumulates _your repo's_ institutional memory of which issue shapes waste loop iterations — **read it before a `refine --all` pass.** It starts empty; the first loop run fills it.
>
> **A common first finding across repos:** stale backlog is the top wasted-iteration cause — issues whose described work already shipped. If your own RCA entries show the same, the highest-ROI response is to treat verify-against-HEAD (RUBRIC §2) as non-negotiable **before tagging**. Confirm it against your own run data before promoting it to Meta-lessons below.

## Meta-lessons (the patterns that recur across entries)

_Promote a lesson here once it has recurred across multiple entries below. (Empty until your first RCA pass.)_

_No meta-lessons yet. Promote a pattern here only after this repository's RCA entries demonstrate recurrence._

## Entries

_Newest first. One entry per distinct lesson. Use the `SKILL.md` template:_

```markdown
### <date> — #<issue> — <short title>  [bucket A|B | <agent-bail category>]
- **Outcome:** PREVENTABLE | INHERENT
- **What could we have done differently:** <the answer, or "nothing — inherent">
- **Rubric/loop change:** <the concrete §2 transformation, §3 disqualifier, or agent-loop-instructions line this produced>
- **Evidence:** <commit / file:line / comment link>
```
