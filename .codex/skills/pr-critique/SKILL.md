# PR Critique — cross-engine relay review

Review an **already-open PR** at its resolved Lean or Deep tier as a different engine
from the one that authored it, fix what you find, and push the fixes back so the
originating engine can re-review. The value is engine diversity: a second model
catches design-level blind spots the authoring engine baked in and would not
question on its own. The hand-back is the point — `pr-critique` is one leg of a
round trip, not a terminal review.

Load `.codex/references/local-review-ledger.md`. The originating engine's
resolved threads are required input to this pass, not optional background.
Telemetry markers are not: exclude them by marker prefix and never carry them
into a lane prompt or packet.

Take the pass telemetry snapshot before reading or classifying anything, per
`.codex/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md` "Pass Telemetry". A relay leg is a full review pass
and costs like one; leaving it out would make cross-engine review look free. The
helper is a no-op when extraction is not enabled for this repository, and it
reports the separate emission gate that decides whether this pass may publish a
record at all.

Read the prior pass before running any lane, per
`.codex/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md` "Read the prior pass before every
review". Read existing `local-review-pass:v3` / `local-review-complete:v3`
attestations, their bodies, and the inline threads they name. Their absence is
normal before the first reviewer and does not itself block a pass. Follow the
current run and any authenticated handoff; do not re-litigate a fingerprint
already dispositioned at this head without new evidence.

This is **not** `deepcritique`. Both are PR-first and use the same thread ledger,
but `deepcritique` runs the current engine's deep matrix, preceded by `refactorpass`
on that engine's first pass over the PR. `pr-critique` is the cross-engine relay
leg: it never runs `refactorpass`, scrutinizes the prior engine's design
decisions, and pushes signed fix commits back to the PR head branch.

A relay leg is still a round for the engine running it. Resolve the round and
stance per the ledger's "Resolve the round, then pick the stance" — from round 3
on, a relay pass narrows to the deploy-blocking lanes, changes the PR only for a
blocking defect, and dispositions the rest without creating unnecessary issues.
At Lean, round 2 is already convergence; follow the tier-specific stance in `critique`.

## Safety preconditions — verify before doing anything

1. **Own-branch only.** This skill pushes. Refuse to run if the checked-out
   branch is `main`, `master`, or `staging`, or is the PR's **base** branch.
   You may only push to the PR's **head** branch.
2. **Confirm the head branch is the current branch at the exact PR head.** If
   the working tree is not on the PR head (e.g. the PR was not fetched into this
   worktree), stop and print the fetch recipe in Phase 0 rather than guessing.
3. **Never force-push.** A plain push only. If the push is rejected because the
   remote head moved, stop and report — do not `--force`.
4. **Never bypass commit signing.** Commit with the repo's normal signing
   config. Do not pass `--no-gpg-sign` or disable `commit.gpgsign`.
5. **Honor signed-commit policy.** When the target branch's effective GitHub
   rules require signatures, the shared run controller checks GitHub's
   verification for every commit introduced by the PR before it authorizes this
   pass. A signed head does not repair an unsigned ancestor. Stop on failure and
   follow its isolated replacement and explicit force-push approval guidance.

## Phase 0: Resolve the PR target

Take the PR number from the invocation (`pr-critique <pr-number>`).

If the PR is not already checked out in this worktree, stop and tell the user to
fetch it in isolation (do not switch branches in a shared checkout):

```bash
HEAD_BRANCH=$(gh pr view <pr-number> --json headRefName --jq .headRefName)
HEAD_REPO=$(gh pr view <pr-number> --json headRepository --jq .headRepository.nameWithOwner)
HEAD_REPO_URL="https://github.com/$HEAD_REPO.git"
git fetch "$HEAD_REPO_URL" \
  "refs/heads/$HEAD_BRANCH:refs/remotes/pr-<pr-number>/head"
git worktree add -b pr-<pr-number>-review ../review-pr-<pr-number> \
  refs/remotes/pr-<pr-number>/head
cd ../review-pr-<pr-number>
# re-run pr-critique <pr-number> here
```

Resolve the PR identity and review scope once. The immutable base SHA may be
supplied by the convergence wrapper as `$AGENT_LOOP_REVIEW_BASE_SHA`, as an
explicit `$PR_CRITIQUE_REVIEW_BASE_SHA`, or — during the rename transition — as
the legacy `$PR_GRILL_REVIEW_BASE_SHA`. There is no precedence between them:
resolve every non-empty override and fail closed when any pair names different
commits. Only a standalone invocation without an override may snapshot the
PR's current `baseRefOid`. Never let individual lanes re-resolve a mutable ref:

```bash
PR_DATA=$(gh pr view <pr-number> \
  --json baseRefName,baseRefOid,headRefName,headRefOid,headRepository)
BASE=$(jq -r .baseRefName <<<"$PR_DATA")
PR_HEAD_SHA=$(jq -r .headRefOid <<<"$PR_DATA")
HEAD_BRANCH=$(jq -r .headRefName <<<"$PR_DATA")
HEAD_REPO=$(jq -r .headRepository.nameWithOwner <<<"$PR_DATA")
HEAD_REPO_URL="https://github.com/$HEAD_REPO.git"
test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$PR_HEAD_SHA" || {
  echo "worktree is not at the PR head — fetch it in isolation first" >&2
  exit 1
}

REVIEW_BASE_SHA=
for candidate in "${AGENT_LOOP_REVIEW_BASE_SHA:-}" \
                 "${PR_CRITIQUE_REVIEW_BASE_SHA:-}" \
                 "${PR_GRILL_REVIEW_BASE_SHA:-}"; do
  [ -n "$candidate" ] || continue
  candidate=$(git rev-parse --verify "$candidate^{commit}") || exit 1
  if [ -n "$REVIEW_BASE_SHA" ] && [ "$REVIEW_BASE_SHA" != "$candidate" ]; then
    echo "review base overrides are set to different commits" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  REVIEW_BASE_SHA=$candidate
done
if [ -z "$REVIEW_BASE_SHA" ]; then
  REVIEW_BASE_SHA=$(jq -r '.baseRefOid // empty' <<<"$PR_DATA")
  [ -n "$REVIEW_BASE_SHA" ] || { echo "PR baseRefOid is unavailable" >&2; exit 1; }
  git fetch -q origin "$BASE"
fi
REVIEW_BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse --verify "$REVIEW_BASE_SHA^{commit}") || exit 1
RANGE="$REVIEW_BASE_SHA..HEAD"
```

Skip docs/config-only changesets (same heuristic as `critique`): if `git diff
--name-only "$RANGE"` contains no source files, report the skip and exit — there
is nothing for the review to find.

## Phase 1: Review at the resolved tier

Resolve the tier from `.codex/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md` and the authenticated tier
marker before selecting work. Being a cross-engine reviewer does not select
Deep. Run `critique` against `$RANGE` at that tier and stance, following that
skill's own lens and execution policy as this prompt root states it. Do not
import another root's. Load only the matching role references; preserve explicit
user choices about independent reviewers. Report the actual lenses and execution
method instead of inferring them from the skill name.

Review lanes are read-only analysis workers. Every spawned lane prompt must say
that the lane may inspect source, diffs, existing tests, and existing CI results,
but must not run test suites, linters, formatters, builds, coverage, package
installation, or CI polling. If dynamic evidence is necessary, the lane returns
the smallest proposed probe to the orchestrator instead of executing it. The
orchestrator alone runs one consolidated validation pass against the final head
after findings are deduplicated and any fixes are complete.

**Cross-engine emphasis.** You are reviewing another engine's work. Beyond
line-level bugs, scrutinize the _design decisions_ the author made and did not
question: chosen abstractions, latency/UX tradeoffs, removed or added special
cases, and whether a "fix" traded away a property the original code protected.
These are the findings a same-engine critique misses and the reason this pass
exists.

## Phase 2: Publish findings, then apply fixes

Verify and deduplicate every finding against the full PR ledger. Post one inline
comment per confirmed root cause before editing, using the local-review marker
and an exact diff anchor. Apply `critique`'s round-matched fix bias to `$RANGE`:
in adversarial rounds, apply its Disposition Bar so harm reduction justifies
churn; in convergence rounds, fix only blocking defects. Record other dispositions
under the ledger and create issues only for concrete urgent follow-ups. Dismiss invalid
findings or suggestions that would make the code worse with the evidence that
disproves them. Critical correctness/security findings must not be silently
dropped. Run the smallest relevant formatter/test command the repo documents
for the files you touched.

## Phase 3: Commit and push (automatic)

If fixes were applied, commit and push without a confirmation gate — this skill
is for your own PR branches.

1. **Label the relay commit** so the cross-engine leg is auditable in `git log`:

   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix(pr-critique): <one-line summary of what the cross-engine pass changed>" \
     --trailer "Cross-engine-review: pr-critique"
   ```

   Use the repo's normal signing config (do not disable it).

2. **Push explicitly to the PR head repository and branch** (plain push, no
   force). Reuse the immutable `HEAD_REPO_URL` and `HEAD_BRANCH` resolved in
   Phase 0:

   ```bash
   git push "$HEAD_REPO_URL" "HEAD:refs/heads/$HEAD_BRANCH"
   ```

   If the push is rejected, stop and report the rejection — do not force-push or
   rebase silently. After a successful push, require both `git ls-remote` for
   that exact branch and `gh pr view --json headRefOid` to equal local `HEAD`.

3. Reply to every posted thread with the fix commit and validation result, then
   resolve it. For a dismissal or tracked deferral, reply with the evidence or
   issue link before resolving. Stop if any thread cannot be replied to or
   resolved.

If no fixes were applied (clean, or everything deferred/dismissed), do not
commit or push. Report the clean result.

## Phase 4: Hand back

Once the pass result is finalized and any fix commits are pushed, take the
prompt-stack digests and emit this pass's telemetry record per
`.codex/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md` "Pass Telemetry", with `--pass-type review` and the
status this pass reached. A record that cannot name the prompt generation it ran
on cannot be compared against the next one, so the two digests are part of
emitting, not an optional extra. Emission exits zero
whether or not it succeeded: report the outcome and move on. Reporting this
pass's own measured spend in the summary below is permitted; reading any earlier
pass's record is not.

Follow the selected local session mode before returning. This skill is one
reviewer pass: never launch another reviewer, retry the pass, or continue the
relay recursively. In auto mode, return to the calling orchestrator so it can
authorize and, if needed, start the next bounded pass. In handoff mode,
post a `local-review-handoff:v1` comment with the `local-review-handoff.py`
helper. The comment
targets `next-pass`'s engine for sequenced runs, otherwise the originating engine.
It pins the head/base and fresh-session prompt for a user-started terminal.

Print a summary aimed at the **originating engine's re-review** — it needs to
know what changed and what to scrutinize:

```text
pr-critique complete on PR #<pr-number> (cross-engine pass).
review depth: <lean | deep>; lenses <selected>; execution <direct | delegated | mixed>
findings fixed:    <count + one-line each>
design tradeoffs flagged: <any decisions the re-review should adjudicate — e.g. a fix
                           that simplified logic but changed a latency/UX property>
deferred / dismissed: <count + rationale>
threads:            <posted/replied/resolved counts>
validation run:    <commands + result>
pushed:            <yes: SHA on <head-branch> | no fixes — nothing pushed>
pinned review base: <full REVIEW_BASE_SHA>

If this pass pushed a fix it moved the head, invalidating every attestation
naming the superseded commit, including the authoring engine's. Those engines
re-run against this HEAD; engines that had not yet attested are unaffected. If
nothing was pushed, no attestation changed.
```

Always surface the design tradeoffs explicitly — the round trip only works if
the engine reviewing next knows where to look.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Does not run `refactorpass`.** No cleanup-churn on a PR under cross-review.
- **Does not open or merge the PR**, and does not push to a base branch.
- **Does not force-push or rebase.** A rejected push is reported, not forced.
- **Does not replace the relay.** `reviewit` drives the hosted Gemini + Copilot
  lane, which runs alongside the local relay rather than instead of it.
  `pr-critique` is one reviewer's lane, not a terminal review.
