// Identify the prompt generation one review pass ran on.
//
// A telemetry record says what a pass cost. Without a prompt identity it
// cannot say what the pass was *running*, so "did that prompt change help"
// has no answer: findings-per-token is a property of the prompt as much as of
// the model. This helper computes the two digests the ledger already carries
// slots for, `promptStackSha256` and `repoInstructionsSha256`.
//
// The two stay separate and are never collapsed into one figure. The synced
// stack is fleet-wide and moves when upstream moves; repo-local instructions
// are per-repository by definition. A combined digest would make every
// repository look like a different prompt generation forever, which destroys
// exactly the cross-repository correlation the hash exists to enable.
//
// This is deliberately a separate script from `usage-snapshot.js` beside it.
// That one reads the session transcript — every file read and every command
// run — which is why it lives in the engine's own skill rather than in the
// vendored ledger bundle. This one reads nothing but files already checked
// into the repository the pass is reviewing, so it inherits none of that
// argument and none of that blast radius.
//
// Always exits 0 and always prints one JSON object. A telemetry defect must
// never fail a review that found real defects.
