# Live upstream documentation checks

Read these primary sources immediately before changing or executing a release.
They are intentionally URLs rather than copied version numbers because npm and
GitHub Actions contracts change.

## npm

- Trusted Publishers: <https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/>
- Staged publishing: <https://docs.npmjs.com/staged-publishing/>
- `npm stage`: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-stage/>
- Provenance statements and verification: <https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements/>
- `npm publish`: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-publish/>
- `npm audit signatures`: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-audit/>
- `npm login`: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-login/>
- `npm logout`: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npm-logout/>
- Package removal policy: <https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish/>

Confirm and record:

1. Minimum Node and npm CLI versions for Trusted Publishing, plus the stricter
   npm 11.12.0 floor required by `--include-attestations` in this verifier.
2. Supported CI providers and runner types.
3. Required OIDC permissions and supported npm operations.
4. Exact Trusted Publisher fields, allowed actions, and package-limit rules.
5. Public/private repository and package limits for automatic provenance,
   including the private-source/public-package unavailable branch.
6. Whether `--provenance` is automatic, required, optional, or unsupported for
   the selected path.
7. Current token restriction, staged-publish CLI version, exact-tarball and flag
   behavior, two-factor approval, first-publication, and unpublish behavior.
8. Current signature and attestation verification command/output.

## GitHub Actions

- `actions/setup-node` README and current release notes:
  <https://github.com/actions/setup-node/blob/main/README.md>
- `actions/setup-node` releases: <https://github.com/actions/setup-node/releases>
- Environments and protection rules:
  <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/deployments-and-environments>
- Managing environments:
  <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/manage-environments>
- Reviewing deployments:
  <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/review-deployments>
- Pinning actions to a full commit SHA:
  <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions>

Confirm and record:

1. Current `actions/setup-node` major release and reviewed full commit SHA.
2. `registry-url`, `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`, `always-auth`, and automatic-cache behavior
   for that exact action revision. Do not assume npm's example uses the latest
   action or that an older `setup-node` behavior still applies.
3. Current GitHub-hosted runner and runner-version requirements.
4. Environment reviewer, self-review, tag-policy, secret-release, and
   administrator-bypass behavior for the repository's plan and visibility.
5. Workflow-call and manual-dispatch identity behavior if a reusable workflow is
   involved; npm may bind trust to the caller rather than the called workflow.

## Reconcile discrepancies

Prefer the most specific current primary source for its own component. If npm's
example references an older `actions/setup-node` major than the action's current
README, do not silently choose either example. Record the mismatch, review release
notes, select a compatible immutable action revision, and validate it in a
non-publishing workflow before release.

Do not use search snippets, marketplace summaries, blog posts, or a prior release
as authority when the primary sources are available. Do not include credentials,
private repository details, or terminal output in the documentation record.
