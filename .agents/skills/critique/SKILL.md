description: PR-first adversarial code review for Antigravity or Gemini CLI. Use after implementation or refactorpass on an open draft PR, especially when the user asks to critique, review hard, find bugs, or run the platform review chain. Posts verified findings inline before fixing, then replies and resolves. Lean mode runs the two highest-signal lanes; the deep matrix runs only when the resolved review tier is Deep.

# Critique

Review an open draft PR adversarially. The goal is to catch bugs, missing tests,
security issues, and convention violations while preserving every verified
finding and disposition in the PR.

## Context Window Check

Run this check before anything else. `critique` runs adversarial review lanes—two in lean mode, six core lanes in deep mode, plus a conditional tenant-coupling lane—each of which reads the diff, reads changed files, and produces structured findings. When subagents/delegation are available the lanes run in parallel, and each subagent inherits cache state from this session; when subagents are not available the lanes run as serial local passes that compete for the same context. Either way, if the current Antigravity or Gemini session has already been heavily used for feature implementation, the lanes start with sharply reduced working windows and `critique` (especially `critique deep`) runs slower and more expensively.

Assess honestly:

- Has this session been writing/editing the feature about to be critiqued? Long conversation, many file edits, dense planning?
- Is the conversation about to brush against compaction territory?

If either is yes, stop and tell the user:

> Your context is heavy from the implementation work. Start a new Antigravity or Gemini session and run `critique` (or `deepcritique`) there. `critique deep`'s full matrix especially needs cache headroom and a fresh session makes the chain materially cheaper.

Do not proceed in the current session unless the user explicitly overrides.

## Stance Resolution

Before selecting lanes, use the controller-authorized `$AGENT_LOOP_REVIEW_ROUND`
or the round supplied by `deepcritique`. Otherwise select one past the active
engine's highest completed round within the latest authenticated
`local-review-run:v1` (1 when it has none), using only pass/complete comments after
that run marker. Resolve Agy as `gemini`, including historical `antigravity`
aliases in its evidence; use `codex` only for a Codex pass. Honor the run's cap and
confirm the round with the shared run controller at
`.codex/skills/critique/scripts/local-review-handoff.py` (`authorize-pass`). If
it is absent from the checkout, report that and stop rather than running
unauthorized.
An ended run, including an aborted one, requires fresh restart authorization:
this controller has no budget-preserving resume command. PR-wide history is a
fallback only when no run marker exists. Use the same engine for every helper
call and result.

- **Adversarial:** Lean round 1 and Deep rounds 1–2. The stance, matrices,
  and fix bias below apply as written.
- **Convergence:** Lean round 2 and Deep rounds 3–4. At Deep both engines have read the
  change cold twice; the goal moves from challenging it to landing it. See
  "Convergence Rounds" below — it overrides the lane selection and the fix bias,
  and nothing else. The post-before-editing, reply, and resolve contract is
  unchanged, and the round cap does not move.

The first pass after escalation and a reviewer's first cold read remain
adversarial regardless of ordinal. State the resolved round and stance in the output.

## Adversarial Stance

Assume there are problems to find. Treat the diff as guilty until each risk is
disproved by code, tests, or documented constraints. Actively look for the
highest-impact failure modes first: data loss, security exposure, silent
failure, broken public contracts, rollout breakage, and missing validation.
Do not soften the search into a general quality pass.

Explicitly audit claims about un-diffed plumbing: when a PR description or comment
claims existing background plumbing already handles a new event, field, or state
transition ("already re-polls", "already listened to", "existing pipe handles this"),
treat the claim as an unverified hypothesis. Open and inspect the referenced producer
or consumer directly to verify its dirty-checking, filtering, and propagation logic.

Still keep the reporting bar high: only report specific, actionable findings
with file/line evidence. If a suspected issue cannot be supported, dismiss it
privately or list it as dismissed with the evidence that disproved it.

## Disposition Bar

Before posting, settle the finding's severity and intended disposition using
[Recover a blocked pass](../../REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md#recover-a-blocked-pass).
A planned follow-up must not be published as a blocking deferral.

Treat validity and actionability as separate decisions. A technically real
concern is not automatically worth changing the PR or growing the backlog.

Fix a confirmed finding only when the expected harm avoided clearly outweighs
the churn and regression risk of the fix. Judge that from concrete evidence:

- how likely a user is to reach the failing path in normal or reasonably
  foreseeable use;
- the impact when they do, the number of users or systems exposed, and whether
  recovery is possible;
- confidence in the root cause and in the proposed correction; and
- the size, complexity, compatibility cost, and regression risk of the change.

For security findings, require a credible exploit path: identify the reachable
boundary, attacker capability and preconditions, missing or bypassable control,
and resulting impact. A theoretical weakness, generic hardening opportunity, or
severity label without a plausible path to discovery and exploitation does not
by itself justify churn.

Create a GitHub issue only for an urgent follow-up: a concrete, high-impact
defect that is important enough to schedule within roughly the next two weeks,
but whose safe fix should not land in this PR. Do not create issues for ordinary
deferred backlog, speculative hardening, cleanup, or low-likelihood edge cases;
record those as `outcome=deferred` with the no-issue rationale if already posted,
or keep them out of the PR ledger when they do not clear the actionable finding
bar.

## Convergence Rounds

When the resolved stance is convergence, run only the lanes that can find a reason not to deploy:
the code reviewer, the silent failure hunter, and the security reviewer when its
signal is present. Drop the type/API design, comment/docs, PR test, and
tenant-coupling lanes. The preceding adversarial passes covered them, and
they audit a surface that regenerates every time it is hardened — guaranteed to
return work, guaranteed not to change what ships.

Brief those lanes exactly as an adversarial round does. They still report every
evidence-backed finding with severity attached; the narrowing is a disposition
rule applied when consolidating lane output, not an instruction to a lane to
withhold what it found.

The actionability bar tightens further. Change the PR only for a **blocking**
defect that also clears the Disposition Bar above — one that is realistically
reachable and ships materially wrong behavior, loses or corrupts data, exposes
a credible security or privacy exploit, breaks a public contract, or breaks
deploy or rollout:

- Fix a blocking finding with the smallest edit that clears it. No refactor, no
  rename, no new abstraction, no test or comment hardening alongside it.
- Defer every confirmed non-blocking finding and resolve its thread. Create and
  link an issue only when it clears the urgent-follow-up bar above; otherwise
  reply with `outcome=deferred` and a concise no-issue rationale. Deferral is the
  expected disposition here, not an admission of scope creep.
- Dismiss invalid findings with evidence, exactly as in an adversarial round.

The findings a convergence round defers may still be real. Fixing them in this
PR is the wrong call when the expected benefit does not justify moving the head
and re-staling the other engine's attestation. Land the change; let only urgent
follow-ups grow the backlog.

A convergence pass with no blocking defect posts its clean-pass attestation
and returns to the controller. Recommend the ship step only after the controller
verifies the remaining exact-head coverage and ledger; unused rounds are not owed.

## Mode

Mode follows the resolved review tier, not the caller's habit. The tier triggers
and the evidence rules live in
[`../../REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md`](../../REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md) under "Review Tier" and
are the only definition; this skill does not carry its own list. **Lean is the
default; Deep is the exception you justify.**

Resolve the effective `local-review-tier:v1` marker under the ledger's
authenticated, forward-only transition rule. If none exists, classify against
the workflow doc's triggers and post the marker before starting a lane. Lean is
the tier when no trigger matches.

- **Lean**: the default. Run the lean two-lane review: code reviewer plus silent failure hunter. This is still an adversarial PR review, not a casual skim.
- **Deep**: run the full independent review matrix below only when the recorded tier is Deep. A `deep` argument handed down from `deepcritique` asserts that recorded tier; a direct human `deep` request is trigger 6 and posts a Deep replacement marker that preserves the recorded triggers and adds 6 before lanes start. Deep mode is intentionally much heavier than lean mode; do not collapse it into one general review pass.

Escalate mid-pass only on a confirmed finding that reaches a trigger, per the
workflow doc's evidence rule, and post the replacement marker naming it. A
suspicion is not evidence. State the resolved tier and the trigger that selected
it in the output.

The tenant-coupling lane catches one customer's values hardcoded into shared
logic and is intentionally not part of the lean two-lane set. A diff that
materially changes customer/tenant-variable behavior — vendor integrations,
per-tenant configuration, prompt/output generation, or data normalization —
trips trigger 1's isolation clause and is classified there rather than by a
separate recommendation here.

## Lane Execution Ownership

Review lanes are read-only analysis workers. Every spawned lane prompt must say
that the lane may inspect source, diffs, existing tests, and existing CI results,
but must not run test suites, linters, formatters, builds, coverage, package
installation, or CI polling. If dynamic evidence is necessary, the lane returns
the smallest proposed probe to the orchestrator instead of executing it.

Mutation probes belong in an orchestrator-owned disposable copy, never the
shared review worktree. Lane agents must not edit source even temporarily.

The orchestrator owns command execution. After all lanes finish, deduplicate and
verify their hypotheses, apply any fixes, then run one consolidated validation
pass against the final head. Do not multiply the same validation across parallel
lanes.

Read the repo-local review addendum first. Check for
`.review/addendum.local.md` in the repository under review; if it exists, read it
before selecting lenses and fold each of its sections into the brief of the lens
it names. It is consumer-owned and never synced, which is what makes it safe to
append to — the role prompts and this skill are overwritten by the next sync, so
a lens learned from a review cycle survives only if it lands there. If a lesson
would be true of any codebase, it belongs in this skill or a role prompt
upstream instead; if it names this repo's flags, paths, or past incidents, it
belongs in the addendum.

## Lean Review Matrix

Lean mode must cover two independent lanes:

1. **Code reviewer** — correctness bugs, regressions, edge cases, broken contracts, project conventions, and meaningful test gaps.
2. **Silent failure hunter** — swallowed errors, partial failures, async races, retries, timeouts, idempotency, and missing observability for critical paths.

Run these lanes as independently as the active runtime permits:

- If subagents/delegation are available and permitted by the active instructions, spawn independent reviewers for both lanes using the ledger's immutable review packet and scoped diff-delivery contract. Keep the packet prefix byte-identical, append only the lens and exact file scope, use no inherited conversation history when supported, and impose a concise output ceiling. Tell each reviewer to return only actionable findings with file/line evidence and avoid relying on conclusions from the other lane.
- If subagents are unavailable or not permitted, perform two separate local passes using the lane prompts above. Do not present that as equivalent to independent subagents.
- If lean mode was requested but independent subagents could not be used, explicitly say so in the output under `review depth`.

## Deep Review Matrix

Deep mode must cover six core independent lanes, plus the conditional tenant-coupling lane when its signal is present:

1. **Code reviewer** — correctness bugs, regressions, edge cases, and broken contracts.
2. **Silent failure hunter** — swallowed errors, partial failures, async races, retries, timeouts, idempotency, and observability gaps.
3. **Type/API design analyzer** — public API shape, type soundness, compatibility, dependency boundaries, and versioning drift.
4. **Comment/docs analyzer** — misleading comments, stale docs, migration instructions, public/private information leaks, and docs that overpromise behavior.
5. **PR test analyzer** — missing tests, weak assertions, CI gaps, fixture realism, and whether validation actually exercises the risk.
6. **Security reviewer** — auth, secrets, injection, supply-chain, workflow permissions, sensitive-data exposure, and fail-closed behavior.
7. **Tenant-coupling reviewer (conditional)** — literals or branches that encode one customer's data, configuration, or vocabulary into shared logic. For every suspicious value ask: _would this still be correct for a second customer with different values?_ If not, move the value to configuration/data with a safe default. Ignore genuinely universal protocol constants, standard enums, and framework keys.

Run these lanes as independently as the active runtime permits:

- Invoking `critique deep` is an explicit request to use independent subagents for
  every applicable lane whenever the active runtime exposes subagent/delegation tools.
  Do not require the user to separately say "use subagents" before spawning
  those lane reviewers.
- If subagents/delegation are available and permitted by the active instructions, spawn independent reviewers using the ledger's immutable review packet and scoped diff-delivery contract. Keep the packet prefix byte-identical, append only the disjoint lens and exact file scope, use no inherited conversation history when supported, and impose a concise output ceiling. Tell each reviewer to return only actionable findings with file/line evidence and avoid relying on conclusions from other lanes.
- If subagents are unavailable or not permitted, perform a separate local pass for every applicable lane using the prompts above. Do not present that as equivalent to independent subagents.
- If deep mode was requested but independent subagents could not be used, explicitly say so in the output under `review depth`.
- Run the tenant-coupling lane as a separate use of the code-reviewer role with the narrow prompt above; do not dilute it into the general correctness lane.

## Process

1. Load `.agents/references/local-review-ledger.md`.
2. Resolve the PR number, verify it is open and its head is the current branch,
   and require local HEAD, remote head, and PR head to match. If the branch has
   no PR, push it and open a draft PR before reviewing.
3. Read every prior review thread, including resolved and outdated threads,
   once at the orchestrator level before inspecting the current PR diff. When
   the caller supplies a pinned base SHA, resolve the reviewed head, changed-file
   list, and stat once, then build the ledger's immutable packet using the same
   literal `<base-sha>..<head-sha>` range for every lane. Do not make each lane
   reload the PR ledger.
4. Skip docs/config-only changes unless the user explicitly wants review.
5. Read `AGENTS.md` and relevant path-specific instructions. Assign every lane
   the exact changed paths its lens needs, and have it pull path-scoped diffs per
   the ledger instead of receiving one pasted or stored whole diff.
6. Resolve the round and stance per "Stance Resolution". In a convergence round,
   the lane list in "Convergence Rounds" replaces steps 7 and 8, and its inverted
   fix bias replaces step 10. Every other step, including step 9, is unchanged.
7. In lean mode, execute every lane in the Lean Review Matrix. Load these role references for lane prompts:
   - `.agents/references/roles/code-reviewer.md`
   - `.agents/references/roles/silent-failure-hunter.md`
     Keep lane findings separated until both lanes complete, then deduplicate by root cause.
8. In deep mode, execute every lane in the Deep Review Matrix. Load these role references for lane prompts:
   - `.agents/references/roles/code-reviewer.md`
   - `.agents/references/roles/silent-failure-hunter.md`
   - `.agents/references/roles/type-design-analyzer.md`
   - `.agents/references/roles/comment-analyzer.md`
   - `.agents/references/roles/pr-test-analyzer.md`
   - `.agents/references/roles/security-reviewer.md`
     When the tenant-coupling signal is present, load `.agents/references/roles/code-reviewer.md` again for the dedicated conditional pass. Keep lane findings separated until all lanes complete, then deduplicate by root cause.
9. Verify and deduplicate lane findings against the source and complete PR
   ledger. For each confirmed root cause, use the deterministic ledger helper
   required by `.agents/references/local-review-ledger.md` to post one inline
   comment on an exact GitHub diff anchor before editing. Do not hand-compose
   review-comment API requests.
10. Apply the Disposition Bar. Fix only findings whose expected harm reduction
    justifies the churn. Defer the rest, and create an issue only for an urgent
    follow-up that should be scheduled within roughly two weeks.
11. Run targeted validation and commit. When
    `$AGENT_LOOP_REVIEW_PUSH_HELPER` is set, accumulate every local fix commit
    across the wrapper pass and invoke the helper exactly once after the final
    fix; a second publication fails closed. Otherwise push normally with no
    force.
12. Use the ledger helper's resumable `dispose` transaction for every posted
    finding. Reconcile failures through the workflow's bounded recovery. On an
    uncertain helper response, retry only the identical command; correct a
    preflight rejection only when it is known to have performed no mutation.
13. Always use the ledger helper's `write-result` command to create the v3
    structured result at `$AGENT_LOOP_REVIEW_RESULT_FILE` when set. The outer
    wrapper validates it and owns the pass/completion attestation. Inside
    agent-loop, omit thread and transition files so the helper fetches and
    derives them. For a blocked pass, call `write-blocked-result` with an
    owner-only blocker file. Outside agent-loop, create the complete
    review-thread export and ordered
    forward-only before-to-after head list as private temporary files, use
    `write-result`, then use `attest --threads-file <path>
--allowed-heads-file <path>`. `attest` verifies the ledger and requires
    `--expected-result-sha256` from `validate-result` before publishing, so
    manual and automated passes share one protocol.

## Output

End with:

- round and stance: `<n>` plus adversarial or convergence
- review depth: lean with independent subagents, lean local two-pass fallback, deep with independent subagents, or deep local multi-pass fallback
- findings fixed
- findings deferred (with an issue link only for urgent follow-ups) or dismissed
  (with one-line evidence)
- validation run
- PR number, reviewed head, comments posted, replies posted, and threads resolved
- the next step under `.agents/REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md`: hand back to the relay for
  the declared reviewers that have not attested this head, and add
  `reviewit <pr>` / `reviewit <pr> deep` whenever a hosted pass is wanted. When
  recommending `reviewit`, recommend a fresh session; the current one has
  absorbed critique findings, fix commits, and (in deep mode) the full review
  matrix.
