name: refactorpass
description: PR-first cleanup pass for Antigravity or Gemini CLI. Use when the user asks for refactoring, cleanup, simplification, or the platform review chain on an open draft PR. Posts verified cleanup suggestions inline before editing, skips docs/config-only changesets, runs a structured cleanup matrix, and pushes, replies, and resolves when appropriate. Runs at most once per PR for this engine.

# Refactor Pass

Run a structured, behavior-preserving cleanup pass on an open draft PR before
adversarial review. This is not a broad refactor, and it is not a step that
repeats each review round: it is the active engine's **one** cleanup pass on that
PR. Resolve the active runtime as `gemini` or `antigravity`; use `codex` only
when Codex is actually running the pass.

## Context Window Check

Run this check before anything else. `refactorpass` (and the `critique` that typically follows) does diff-reading, multi-lane reviewing, and edit application — all cache-hungry. If the current Antigravity or Gemini session has already been heavily used for feature implementation, the cache is largely spent on context the cleanup pass does not need, and the downstream `critique` (especially `critique deep`'s six independent lanes) will be measurably slower and more expensive.

Assess honestly:

- Has this session been writing/editing the feature about to be cleaned up? Long conversation, many file edits, dense planning?
- Is the conversation about to brush against compaction territory?

If either is yes, stop and tell the user:

> Your context is heavy from the implementation work. Start a new Antigravity or Gemini session and run `refactorpass` (and `critique` / `deepcritique`) there. The downstream lanes need cache headroom and a fresh session makes the chain materially cheaper.

Do not proceed in the current session unless the user explicitly overrides.

## Fix Bias

Apply every valid cleanup `refactorpass` surfaces in this pass. Skip suggestions only when they are wrong: would change behavior, would make the code worse, would introduce speculative abstraction, or are based on a misread of the diff. Do not defer valid cleanups to a "follow-up PR" — the only legitimate defer is a major architectural rework (roughly 300+ lines or a cross-cutting redesign), and in that case file a GitHub issue at deferral time rather than leaving the suggestion as an undocumented todo. Reason: every valid cleanup that ships becomes the floor for the next PR in this area, and letting them accrue as "deferred" turns the backlog into review noise and makes future cleanups more expensive.

## Cleanup Matrix

Refactorpass must cover three lanes:

1. **Simplicity/DRY lane** — remove fresh duplication, collapse awkward control flow, inline one-use abstractions, delete dead code, and simplify names when the diff makes intent clearer.
2. **Correctness-preserving lane** — look for cleanup that reduces bug risk without changing behavior: narrower conditions, safer defaults, clearer error paths, less state mutation, and tighter async/resource cleanup.
3. **Convention/API lane** — align fresh code with local patterns, package boundaries, exports, dependency placement, and documented repo conventions.

Run these lanes as independently as the active runtime permits:

- If subagents/delegation are available and permitted by the active instructions, spawn independent cleanup reviewers for the three lanes using the ledger's immutable review packet and scoped diff-delivery contract. Keep the packet prefix byte-identical, append only the cleanup lens and exact file scope, use no inherited conversation history when supported, and impose a concise output ceiling. Tell each reviewer to suggest behavior-preserving cleanup and avoid broad rewrites.
- If subagents are unavailable or not permitted, perform three separate local passes using the lane prompts above. Do not present that as equivalent to independent subagents.
- If refactorpass could not use independent subagents, explicitly say so in the output under `cleanup depth`.

## Process

1. Load `.agents/references/local-review-ledger.md`.
2. Verify the branch is not `main`, `master`, or `staging`. Resolve or create
   its draft PR before running cleanup lanes, and require local, remote, and PR
   heads to match. Read all prior review threads.
3. Use the exact base SHA supplied by an invoking `deepcritique` or caller. Only
   when run standalone without a supplied base, resolve `@{u}` when available,
   otherwise the default branch, once. Resolve the reviewed head, changed-file
   list, and diff stat once and build the ledger's immutable review packet. Pass
   the literal `<base-sha>..<head-sha>` range to every cleanup lane; never let
   lanes re-resolve a mutable ref or rebuild the packet independently.
4. Skip if the changeset is docs/config-only. Treat source files such as `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.py`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.h`, `.cs`, `.rb`, `.swift`, `.kt`, `.sh`, and `.bash` as review-worthy.
5. Check the once-per-engine latch. Search the PR's comments for
   `local-review-refactor:v1 engine=<active-engine>`, authored by the actor
   running this review. If it is present, this PR has already had that engine's cleanup pass:
   report the skip with the head the earlier pass ran on and stop without running
   a lane. Continue only when the marker is absent or the caller explicitly asked
   to force a re-run, and say which of the two applied.

   The rule exists because the second pass over an already-simplified diff
   returns naming and shape churn, not cleanups. That churn moves the head and
   re-stales the other engine's attestation for no shipped benefit.

6. Assign each lane the exact changed source paths its lens needs and execute
   every lane in the Cleanup Matrix. Follow the ledger's scoped-read contract;
   do not hand every lane a whole-diff artifact.
7. Consolidate lane suggestions, verify them, and deduplicate them against the
   complete PR ledger.
8. Post each confirmed cleanup inline before editing, then apply only cleanup
   that is behavior-preserving and clearly improves the fresh diff.
9. Keep scope tight: touch only code changed by the current branch unless a tiny adjacent edit is required to finish the cleanup safely.
10. Do not introduce feature behavior, broad rewrites, unrelated style churn, formatting-only commits, or speculative abstraction.
11. Run the smallest relevant formatter/test command if the repo documents one.
12. If changes were made, commit them as `refactor: <active-engine> cleanup pass - <summary>` (e.g. `refactor: gemini cleanup pass - <summary>`).
    When `$AGENT_LOOP_REVIEW_PUSH_HELPER` is set, leave the commit local for the
    enclosing critique pass so that wrapper invocation publishes exactly once;
    otherwise push without force. Reply to each cleanup thread with the commit and
    validation, then resolve it.
13. Whether or not the lanes produced changes, post one informational PR comment
    closing the latch for this engine, carrying the ledger's marker:

    ```text
    <!-- local-review-refactor:v1 engine=<active-engine> head=<reviewed-sha> outcome=<committed|no-op> -->
    ```

    Post it only for a pass that actually ran the cleanup lanes. A docs/config-only
    skip leaves the latch open, so a later round whose changeset contains source
    can still spend the one pass.

## Output

Report:

- cleanup depth: independent subagents, local three-pass fallback, docs/config-only skip, or no source changes
- latch state: first pass for this engine, skipped because already spent at `<sha>`, or forced re-run
- whether changes were made
- commit SHA if created
- validation run
- PR number plus comments, replies, and resolved-thread counts
- recommended next step from the selected path: if invoked by `deepcritique`,
  return so it can run `critique deep`; if run standalone, run `deepcritique`
  next and hand to the next declared reviewer only after that full chain; add
  `reviewit <pr-number>` whenever a hosted pass is wanted
