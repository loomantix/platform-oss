"""List the backlog-refinement queue: open issues not yet assessed for agent-readiness.

An issue is "un-refined" when it carries neither `agent: refined` nor any
`agent-bail:*` label and is not already `dev: agent`. Those are the issues
`/backlog-refinement refine` should process. Epics and obvious tracking issues
are surfaced separately so the operator can see them without them polluting the
work queue.

A `dev: agent` issue that is ALSO `agent: refined` was tagged by this skill and
is trusted-ready. But a `dev: agent` issue WITHOUT `agent: refined` was tagged by
something else — older triage, a bulk import, a parallel pass — and has never been
verified-against-HEAD. `refine --all` walks only the un-refined bucket, so these
pre-tagged issues are silently skipped and feed `/agent-loop` stale work. They are
surfaced as a distinct "re-verify" bucket so the operator re-assesses them (same
verify-against-HEAD + §1 pass as a fresh refine) before trusting the queue. When
such an issue ALSO carries a bail label the bail wins and it classifies as
excluded, but it is still surfaced — under "Conflicted" — because the leftover
`dev: agent` label misrepresents the issue's real queue state to anything that
reads labels directly. `/agent-loop` itself is not fooled: it selects through
`ready.py`, which hard-excludes `agent-bail:*`.

Mirrors the gh-invocation conventions of `../../issues/scripts/ready.py`.
